# 2dgame-demo
new GigaGal physics (more realistic momentum / inertia, change of direction and double jump), renderings (including sprites, textures, animations, [overlays]) and abilities (hover, charge cannon) are implemented atop udacity/ud406 excercise 2.8.06 as of its last update on 6-29-2016


To do:

-stamina and/or damage gauge HUD

-more GigaGal abilities (burst of speed, ricochet off walls)

-update physics (detect intersection with sides of certain platforms)

-code refactor for safety, readability and reusability

-different kinds of ammo (awarded post-boss fights? or strategically placed powerups\*)

-more enemies (aerial, projectile, conductive e.g. electricity to liquid, heat to metal), platforms and powerups

-levels

-bosses

-backgrounds

-title screen

-level select screen (8 selectable + 1 final? where could more linearity and/or openness be beneficial + specific implementations\*)

-music

-improved mobile controls

\*to what extent would breaking from conventions of mega man series not alienate fanbase i.e. what facets are necessary to keep engaged?
